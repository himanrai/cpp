[1] We are going to learn about "Factory" (i.e., concrete factory) design pattern.

[2] In GoF (Gang of Four) there is no design pattern called "Factory".
    Gof have "Factory Method" and "Abstarct Factory" design patterns.

[3] Firstly refer "factory method" design pattern:
    "cpp/design-patterns/creational/1a_factory_method1/*"

    - We have 2 factory methods inside Point.
    - We want to do more in terms of seperation of concern
    - We have dedicated code (2 factory methods) which is dedicated for the
      construction of Point object - why not move it to a seperate class.
    - That's exactly we are going to do with "Factory" design pattern.
