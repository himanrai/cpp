[1] Receiving functions as arguments

- In the 02_filter_females.cpp, you wanted to get the names of all females
  in a collection. Suppose you have a collection of people and often need
  to get the names that satisfy a certain predicate, but you donâ€™t want to
  limit yourself to a predefined predicate such as is_female. You want to
  support any predicate that takes a person_t. The user might want to separate
  the people based on their age, hair color, marital status, and so on.

- Refer names_for()
  Creating a function that you could call multiple times would be useful.
  The function would need to accept a vector of people and a predicate function
  to be used for filtering, and it would return a vector of strings containing
  the names of people satisfying that predicate.

    template <typename FilterFunction>
    std::vector<std::string> names_for(
            const std::vector<person_t>& people,
            FilterFunction filter)
